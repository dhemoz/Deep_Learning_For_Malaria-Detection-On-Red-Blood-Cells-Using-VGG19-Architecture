# DEEP LEARNING FOR MALARIA DETECTION ON RED BLOOD CELLS USING VGG19 ARCHITECTURE

Statement mentioning death from malaria as a serious problem, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported around 219 million cases of malaria in 2018. Malaria has been detected worldwide and an estimated 405,000 cases have ended up dead. Early detection and treatment of malaria sufferers is very important because it can help delay the progression of the disease, symptoms, and know how to prevent it. In this study, a malaria detection system was designed which has two categories, namely infected and uninfected. The design system uses the CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) method with VGG-19 architecture based on blood images as input. The input image in this study is a collection of data from Kaggle, called Malaria's Dataset. The data set will be pre-processed to improve image quality, then use the CNN method and the VGG-19 architecture for processing. The research classification will be divided into two categories. The system performance parameters used for testing are accuracy, precision, withdrawal rate, and F1 score. It is expected that the system accuracy performance results will reach more than 85%.
